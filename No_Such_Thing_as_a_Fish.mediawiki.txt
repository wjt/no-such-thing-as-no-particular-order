==Title==
The title for ''No Such Thing as a Fish'' comes from a fact in the ''QI'' TV series. In the third episode of eighth series, also known as "Series H", an episode on the theme of "Hoaxes" reported that after a lifetime studying fish the biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] concluded that there was no such thing as a [[fish]]. He reasoned that while there are many sea creatures, most of them are not closely related to each other. For example, a [[salmon]] is more closely related to a [[camel]] than it is to a [[hagfish]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Hoaxes|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/8/3/|series=QI|serieslink=QI|network=BBC|station=BBC One|city=London|airdate=1 October 2010|seriesno=H|number=3|transcript=QI Transcripts|transcripturl=https://sites.google.com/site/qitranscripts/transcripts/8x03}}</ref> The opening of early episodes of the podcast used to feature a recording of the elves mentioning this fact, which appears in the first paragraph of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life''.<ref name=oxford2005>{{cite book|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=Andrew|editor2-last=Dawes|editor2-first=John|title=Encyclopedia of Underwater Life: Aquatic Invertebrates and Fishes|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192806741|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806741.001.0001/acref-9780192806741-e-52|chapter=Fish, What is a?|doi=10.1093/acref/9780192806741.001.0001}}</ref><ref name="Dessau">{{cite web|last=Dessau|first=Bruce|authorlink=Bruce Dessau|title=Podcast Review: No Such Thing as a Fish|publisher=Beyond the Joke|url=http://www.beyondthejoke.co.uk/content/784/podcast-review-no-such-thing-fish|date=29 April 2014|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>

In each episode each presenter takes it in turn to present their favourite fact that they have come across that week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qi.com/podcast/podcast-about|title=About the Podcast|publisher=''QI''|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref> They discuss the information surrounding that fact, and the other presenters add in extra facts and information connecting to it.

==Production==
In an interview with ''[[ThreeWeeks]]'', Schreiber said the podcast, "came about because too many facts in the ''QI'' office kept going to waste. Like the time Chief Elf James Harkin looked up from his computer and said: 'You know there are currently over 600 guys in the world with two dicks'. We decided to gather round a microphone once a week and share our favourite facts we'd found that week."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooke|first=Chris|url=http://www.threeweeks.co.uk/article/dan-schreiber-the-idiot-elf-arrives-at-the-fringe/|title=Dan Schreiber: The idiot elf arrives at the Fringe|publisher=[[ThreeWeeks]]|date=23 July 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> Murray told ''[[The Independent]]'': "We almost released it by mistake. We uploaded it and only mentioned it on our own personal social media accounts. We thought it was good, but the reaction has been lovely. It seems like there's a real appetite for more podcasts like this. There is a feeling of resurgence of the whole medium."<ref>{{cite news|last=Usborne|first=Simon|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/serial-mania-has-propelled-podcasts-into-the-cultural-mainstream-9934634.html|title=Serial podcast finale: Mania has propelled podcasts into the cultural mainstream|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=19 December 2014}}</ref>

Episodes are normally recorded at the ''QI'' offices in [[Covent Garden]], although there have been live recordings in other locations.

==Reception==
[[Miranda Sawyer]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' gave the podcast a positive review writing, "the podcast is jolly, packed with impressive and silly facts, and so far hasn't descended into too much in-joke chumminess, so hooray for ''No Such Thing As a Fish''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|authorlink=Miranda Sawyer|title=No Such Thing As a Fish; Freakonomics – podcast reviews|publisher=''[[The Observer]]''|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/23/no-such-thing-as-a-fish-freakonomics-podcast-reviews|date=23 March 2014|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref>

Comedy critic [[Bruce Dessau]] wrote on his ''Beyond the Joke'' blog that: "All it lacks is the likes of [[Alan Davies]] [a panelist on the TV version of ''QI''] and co chipping in with their comedic quips, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had."<ref name="Dessau"/>

In December 2014 the podcast was named by Apple as the "Best New Podcast" for 2014.<ref name="Best New Podcast"/> In March 2015 the "Internet Award" in the 2015 [[Chortle Awards]].<ref name ="Chortle"/>
