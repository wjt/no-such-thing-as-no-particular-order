Cheesy stats about [No Such Thing As A Fish](http://qi.com/podcast).

* [Exhibit A](http://t.wjt.me.uk/post/103200834183/no-such-thing-as-no-particular-order)
* [Exhibit B](http://t.wjt.me.uk/post/137976062205/still-no-such-thing-as-no-particular-order)

Note that this only operates on a cached copy of the episode list from Wikipedia, back in Jan 2016. The list of episodes was moved to a separate page and [subsequently deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_No_Such_Thing_as_a_Fish_episodes) since the fine people who edit Wikipedia did not see the value in a plain-text summary of episodes. Thanks!
